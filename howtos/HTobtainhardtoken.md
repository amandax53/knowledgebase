# How to: Obtain a Hard Token

Before you start, you will need:
 - Access to a computer with internet 
 - Your work email address and state PC password available.

## Overview
The state recently started using a security feature called **Multi-Factor Authentication** (“MFA”). Prior to using MFA, anyone with your username and password could access your account. As MFA requires both your dynamic token code and password, your account remains protected even if your username and password are stolen.

This guide explains how to obtain a token for remote access to secure state applications.

## Background
When using a personal device or a state device not on the state network, a “token” is required to access services including email, WMS, Horizon VDI, and On-Base.

**Software tokens**: A “soft” token uses the RSA SecurID app to generate a numeric passcode code. Each code is valid for 60 seconds. If a code expires, the user may regenerate a new code to access state applications remotely.

**Hardware tokens**: A “hard” token is a physical device that periodically generates passcodes

## Obtain a Hard Token
1. Visit the token Self-Service console:

	    https://mytoken.ny.gov/

2. Log on by entering your work email address as your username.

3. Select “**Password**” for **Authentication Method** and click log on.

4. Enter the password used for your state PC and click log on.

*Note: You will be prompted to set up security questions and answers the first time you access the state token website.*
\
\
\
5. Select **Request a new token** from the **My Authenticators** section.

You can only obtain hard tokens as a key FOB. After your request is approved, they are typically shipped 2-3 weeks later.

*Note: If you use a state-issued mobile device, you must use a soft token. To obtain a soft token, please refer to the How-To linked in the “**See also**” section.*
\
\
\
6.  Select **Hardware** from the list and click **Submit**.
\
\
\
7. Enter a **Reason for Token Request**. A common reason is “need for out-of-office access due to COVID-19”.
\
\
\
8. Enter your **Shipping Address** for your token. Ensure you use an address where you can reliably receive mail.
\
\
\
9. Click **Submit**. A confirmation page will be displayed, along with additional information on receiving your hard token.

*Note: When your administrator approves your request for a hard token, you will receive an email from [Enterprise.RSA.Prod@its.ny.gov](mailto:Enterprise.RSA.Prod@its.ny.gov). Save this email until you activate your physical hard token.*
