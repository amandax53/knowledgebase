# Quickstart: Soft Tokens

## Overview
This Quickstart guides you through:

 1. Installing the RSA SecurID app.
 2. Importing your soft token.
 3. Using your soft token to access secure state applications remotely.

It is intended for users who require remote access to secure state applications. It assumes that you have basic knowledge of:
- Installing an app to your mobile device
- Using your work email and password to log on to state applications.

## Before you start
Before running this Quickstart, complete the following prerequisites:
 1. Request a soft token
 2. Wait for notification that your soft token request was approved

**IMPORTANT**:  To complete this Quickstart, in addition to your mobile device, you must have access to a second device with an internet connection, such as your state PC.

## Part 1: Install the token app

 1. Using your mobile device, go to your device’s app store and search
    for RSA SecurID.
      
 2. Download the RSA SecurID and open the application when the download
    finishes.
    
3. Read and **Accept** the license agreement for the application.

## Part 2: Import your token

When your soft token has been approved by your administrator, you will receive notification via email.

1. Using your second device (i.e., state PC), visit the token Self-Service Console and log on:

	    https://mytoken.ny.gov/

2. Click **Activate Your Token** in the **My Authenticators** section.

3. A window opens with a QR code on the screen. Open the RSA SecurID app on your mobile device. Select the QR code symbol in the bottom left corner of the RSA app. You must allow the setting for RSA SecurID to access your camera by selecting **OK** to proceed.

4. After selecting **OK**, aim your mobile device’s camera at the QR code on the screen. The RSA app will import your token. A confirmation message displays on your computer and mobile device if the import is successful.

## Part 3: Use your token

This example assumes you are using a non-state device to log on to a secure state application, such as email.

1. Visit outlook.office.com and log on using your work email and state PC password. Click Sign in.

2. On the next screen, it prompts for your RSA SecurID passcode. Open the RSA app on your mobile device.

3. Enter the PIN you created when requesting a token.

4. An 8-digit passcode appears on your mobile device’s screen. The passcode resets every 60 seconds.

5. Enter the passcode in the prompted area and click **Submit** to complete the log on process.

*Note: If you have trouble logging in, please verify you entered the correct PIN. **If you enter the incorrect PIN in the RSA app, a passcode will generate but the passcode will not work.***
