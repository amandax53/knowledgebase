# Quickstart: Hard Tokens
You must have access to a device with an internet connection, such as your state PC, to complete this Quickstart.

## Overview
This Quickstart guides you through:

 1. Setting up your hard token.
 2. Using your hard token to access secure state applications remotely.

It is intended for users who require remote access to secure state applications. It assumes that you have basic knowledge of using your work email and password to log on to state applications.

## Before you start
Before running this Quickstart, complete the following prerequisites:
- Request a hard token.
- Wait for the email notification that your hard token request was approved.
- Receive the physical hard token via US Mail from ITS.

## Part 1: Activate your hard token
1. Open the email confirming your tokenâ€™s approval. The email is from: [Enterprise.RSA.Prod@its.ny.gov](mailto:Enterprise.RSA.Prod@its.ny.gov)

2. Confirm the serial number on your physical hard token matches the serial number in the email.

3. Click the link in the email for **Token enablement.**

4. Type your **user name** (your work email address), the token **enablement code** from the email, and the hard token **serial number**. Click **OK**.

5. The screen should display a message confirming your token is ready to use. Click **OK**.

6. Click **Create PIN**.

7. Enter a **PIN** that is between 4 and 8 digits. It cannot start with 0. Document the PIN, as you will use it with your hard token. Click **Save**.

## Part 2: Use your token
This example assumes you are using a non-state device to log on to a secure state application, such as email.

1. Visit **outlook.office.com** and log on using your work email and state PC password. Click **Sign in**.

2. In the prompted area, enter the **PIN** you created when requesting a token, immediately followed by the **passcode** displayed on your hard token.

*Example*: If your PIN is **1234** and your hard token displayed code **987654**, you would enter **1234987654** in the prompted field.

3. Enter the passcode in the prompted area and click **Submit** to complete the log on process.
